&emsp; <input type="checkbox"> 1 leek, sliced into rings </br>
&emsp; <input type="checkbox"> 2 carrots, grated </br>
&emsp; <input type="checkbox"> 100 g fresh spinach, chopped </br>
&emsp; <input type="checkbox"> ½ red bell pepper, diced </br>
&emsp; <input type="checkbox"> 4 eggs </br>
&emsp; <input type="checkbox"> 4 tbsp oil or olive oil </br>
&emsp; <input type="checkbox"> 4 tbsp milk </br>
&emsp; <input type="checkbox"> 4 tbsp flour </br>
&emsp; <input type="checkbox"> 2 tsp baking powder </br>
&emsp; <input type="checkbox"> 2 tsp salt </br>
&emsp; <input type="checkbox"> 1 tsp black pepper </br>
&emsp; <input type="checkbox"> 50 g grated cheddar cheese </br>
&emsp; <input type="checkbox"> sesame seeds and nigella seeds (optional) </br>

### 📝 Preparation

Whisk the eggs with oil, then add flour and finally milk.  
Stir in baking powder, salt, and pepper.  

In a large bowl, mix all the vegetables together. Combine with the egg mixture and spread evenly on a baking tray lined with parchment paper.  

Bake at 180°C (≈355°F) for 30 minutes.  
Remove from the oven, sprinkle with grated cheese, sesame, and nigella seeds, and bake for another 30 minutes.  

Check for doneness — it depends on the size and moisture of your veggies.  
Cut into squares and enjoy warm.  

It’s tasty cold too… but I’ve never had the chance to find out — it disappears too fast 😄
