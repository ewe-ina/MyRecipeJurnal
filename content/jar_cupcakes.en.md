## Jar Cupcakes

![def]

Because I had to carry four of them on my bike — and with regular cupcakes, that’s a pretty risky mission 😉

### 🥥 Cream (for 4 jars)

&emsp; ⬜ thick part from 1 can of coconut milk (mine was 85% coconut extract), chilled overnight </br>
&emsp; ⬜ lemon jelly powder with agar (mine was already sweetened) </br>
&emsp; ⬜ a few drops of blue food coloring (optional, I just had it on hand 😉) </br>

Whip the chilled coconut cream (I used a hand mixer) in a tall bowl.  
Gradually add the jelly powder and mix until smooth.  
Add a few drops of coloring if you’d like, then stir with a spoon.  
Spoon the cream into 4 jars and pop them into the fridge.  
(I got about 4 tablespoons per jar, but you can make smaller portions or use the cream to decorate the cupcakes.)

### 🍌 Cupcakes – about 10 pieces  

🔹 Oven: top-bottom heat, 200°C / 400°F, 18 min

&emsp; ⬜ 2 very ripe bananas (the kind everyone keeps ignoring 😉) </br>
&emsp; ⬜ ½ cup oil </br>
&emsp; ⬜ 1 cup flour </br>
&emsp; ⬜ 2 tbsp cocoa powder </br>
&emsp; ⬜ 1 tsp baking soda </br>
&emsp; ⬜ the rest of the coconut milk from the can </br>
&emsp; ⬜ a big handful of blueberries </br>
&emsp; ⬜ 4 squares of dark chocolate, chopped </br>

Mash the bananas with a fork in a bowl.  
Add everything except the blueberries and chocolate.  
Mix with a hand mixer until just combined. (No need to bother with separate “wet” and “dry” bowls 😉)  
Add the blueberries and chocolate, and gently stir with a spoon.  
Divide the batter into muffin cups (I use metal molds lined with paper cases, placed on a rack).  
Bake at 200°C for 18 minutes.  
Let cool, then place one cupcake in each jar (without the paper liner 😉).

### 🍫 Topping & Extras

&emsp; ⬜ ½ tbsp coconut oil </br>
&emsp; ⬜ 8 squares dark chocolate </br>
&emsp; ⬜ a handful of blueberries </br>
&emsp; ⬜ a few chopped walnuts </br>

In a small saucepan over low heat, melt the coconut oil, then add the chocolate.  
Stir constantly until melted and smooth, then remove from heat.  
I usually don’t wait for it to cool — I just drizzle it right away over the cupcakes (including the ones in jars).  
Sprinkle with chopped walnuts and decorate with blueberries (add a few extra to the jars).  
Chill both the jars and the loose cupcakes for a few hours — or, honestly, eat the loose ones right away 😋

Enjoy! 💙
