## Eggplant and Tofu Stew

![def]

I found some sad-looking eggplants on sale and decided to rescue one. The tofu joined the adventure mid-cooking 😉

### 🍚 Millet Base

&emsp; ⬜ 150 g millet </br>
&emsp; ⬜ water </br>
&emsp; ⬜ a pinch of salt </br>

I’m really lazy in the kitchen! I don’t rinse the millet in hot and cold water or do any fancy tricks 😉  
I just pour the millet into a small pot, cover it with boiling water from the kettle — about twice the height of the millet, maybe a bit more — add salt, cover with a lid, and cook on low heat.  
(No stirring needed! And I use boiling water because my old electric stove takes ages to heat up — I’d boil myself from impatience before it does 😅)

### 🍆 The Stew

&emsp; ⬜ 1 tbsp oil </br>
&emsp; ⬜ 1 onion </br>
&emsp; ⬜ salt </br>
&emsp; ⬜ 2 tomatoes </br>
&emsp; ⬜ 1 eggplant </br>
&emsp; ⬜ a bit of water </br>
&emsp; ⬜ herb seasoning mix (like Knorr “for herbed chicken” 😉) </br>
&emsp; ⬜ 1 block firm tofu </br>

Heat oil in a pan. Add diced onion. (This is when I start cooking the millet.) Sprinkle some salt.  
Add chopped tomatoes and eggplant (cut into cubes or long slices).  
Pour in a little water — just enough so it doesn’t burn — and cover to let it simmer. (Perfect moment to prep the toppings!)  
Remove the lid, add the seasoning, stir, then grate the tofu (use the side you’d use for cheese 🙂) and toss it in.  
Mix everything and let it warm through while you plate up the millet and toppings.

### 🥑 Toppings

&emsp; ⬜ 1 avocado </br>
&emsp; ⬜ 1 pickled chili pepper </br>
&emsp; ⬜ a few olives </br>
&emsp; ⬜ a handful of spinach </br>

Mash the ripe avocado with a fork. Finely chop the chili and olives, and mix them with the avocado.  
Serve it beautifully on a few spinach leaves — we eat with our eyes, too!

\* No one likes footnotes! But this is a good one 🙂 The time includes everything — from grabbing ingredients to plating up — so it’s really not that bad!

Enjoy! 💚
