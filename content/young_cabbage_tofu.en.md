#### Ingredients

##### 🍜 Pasta

&emsp; <input type="checkbox"> your favorite pasta (I used whole grain – “łazanki” noodles would be perfect 🙂) </br>

##### 🥬 The Stir-fry

&emsp; <input type="checkbox"> 1 tbsp oil </br>
&emsp; <input type="checkbox"> 1/2 onion </br>
&emsp; <input type="checkbox"> salt </br>
&emsp; <input type="checkbox"> 1/2 head young cabbage </br>
&emsp; <input type="checkbox"> a bit of water </br>
&emsp; <input type="checkbox"> 1 block firm tofu </br>
&emsp; <input type="checkbox"> spices (I used hot paprika, turmeric, salt, and... something brown 😛) </br>

#### Preparation

1. Heat oil in a pan.  
2. Add diced onion and a pinch of salt.  
3. Toss in the shredded cabbage, add a splash of water, and cover to let it soften.  
4. Dice the tofu finely, coat it with the spices, and add it to the cabbage.  
5. Give it a stir — and that’s it! 😄  

It might not win a beauty contest, but it’s seriously tasty 😋
