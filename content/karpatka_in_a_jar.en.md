Or rather – a Karpatka-style variation 😄

🔹 5 servings </br>

#### 🍪 Cookie Base  

&emsp; <input type="checkbox"> about 150 g biscuits (e.g. plain tea biscuits – vegan, sugar-free, palm-oil-free; I only found one perfect match – **Ania brand biscuits** with wheat flour and coconut fat; this time I used crackers proudly labeled “no palm oil”) </br>
&emsp; <input type="checkbox"> 3 tablespoons coconut oil </br>
&emsp; <input type="checkbox"> xylitol, to taste </br>

Blend the biscuits in a food processor, adding coconut oil gradually until the texture resembles wet sand 🙂  
Sweeten to taste. Press the mixture firmly onto the bottom of the jars.

#### 🥥 Cream  

&emsp; <input type="checkbox"> 1 can coconut milk (85% coconut extract), chilled overnight </br>
&emsp; <input type="checkbox"> 1 cup water </br>
&emsp; <input type="checkbox"> 1 packet sugar-free vanilla pudding mix (40 g) </br>
&emsp; <input type="checkbox"> 3 tablespoons vanilla xylitol (I keep a jar of xylitol with a split vanilla pod 💛) </br>

Scoop the solid part of the coconut milk into a bowl and keep it in the fridge.  
Pour the liquid part into a saucepan, add most of the water (save 1/3 cup), and heat.  
Dissolve the pudding mix and xylitol in the remaining water, then pour into the saucepan while stirring.  
Cook until thickened – just like making pudding from a packet 😉  
Remove from heat, cover, and let cool completely.  
Once cooled, add the solid coconut cream and beat on low speed until smooth and fluffy.  
Spoon over the cookie base in jars.

#### 🍒 Toppings  

&emsp; <input type="checkbox"> a handful of puffed rice </br>
&emsp; <input type="checkbox"> a few cherries from your cellar preserves 🙂 </br>

Add some puffed rice and cherries to each jar.  
Chill in the fridge before serving.  
Best enjoyed when mixed all together 😃

Enjoy! 💙
