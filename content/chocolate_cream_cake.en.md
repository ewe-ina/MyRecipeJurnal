For everyone who believes that when in doubt — choose chocolate.

🔹 Oven: top–bottom heat, 180°C, 30 min </br>

#### 🥣 Sponge

&emsp; <input type="checkbox"> ⅓ cup oil </br>
&emsp; <input type="checkbox"> 1 cup soy milk </br>
&emsp; <input type="checkbox"> 1 tbsp vinegar* </br>
&emsp; <input type="checkbox"> 1½ cups flour </br>
&emsp; <input type="checkbox"> ½ cup erythritol </br>
&emsp; <input type="checkbox"> 2 tsp baking soda </br>

Pour oil, milk, and vinegar into a bowl. Mix and leave for 3 minutes. (This is a trick to make the sponge fluffy – after adding vinegar the milk protein will curdle). Gradually add flour and erythritol, whisk energetically. Finally, add baking soda, mix, and pour the batter into a lightly oiled pan.  

Bake in preheated oven (top-bottom, 180°C) about 30 min, until a toothpick comes out clean (the top will brown and crack slightly). Remove and let cool (it can also cool in the open oven).  
Remove sponge from the pan and cut into layers only after it has completely cooled. (You can bake it a day before.)

\* Why vinegar? We want the sponge fluffy without eggs. Besides curdling milk, the reaction between vinegar and baking soda produces CO₂ bubbles 🙂 (let the batter rest for a moment and you'll see tiny bubbles on the surface).

#### 🍫 Chocolate Cream

&emsp; <input type="checkbox"> 2 bars dark chocolate (200 g) </br>
&emsp; <input type="checkbox"> 1 packet vanilla pudding powder (40 g, unsweetened) </br>
&emsp; <input type="checkbox"> just under 2 cups soy milk </br>
&emsp; <input type="checkbox"> 4 tbsp solid coconut oil (100 g) </br>
&emsp; <input type="checkbox"> 5 tbsp peanut butter (100 g) </br>
&emsp; <input type="checkbox"> 1½ cups erythritol** </br>
&emsp; <input type="checkbox"> 50 ml vodka </br>

Melt chocolate in a bain-marie and let cool.  
Prepare pudding according to instructions, using less milk and no sugar. Let cool.  
Beat coconut oil, peanut butter, and erythritol. Gradually add melted chocolate, then pudding. Finally, pour in the vodka.  
The cream is thick; for a larger cake you can add a second pudding.  
Chill 1–2 hours in the fridge to firm up.

** Powdered erythritol is better – cream won’t crunch 😉

#### 🎂 Assembly & Decoration

&emsp; <input type="checkbox"> ½ cup water </br>
&emsp; <input type="checkbox"> 1 tsp instant coffee </br>
&emsp; <input type="checkbox"> blueberries </br>

Carefully remove cooled sponge from pan and cut into 2 layers.  
Moisten both layers with coffee.  
Spread cream on the first layer, place second on top, cover sides and top with cream.  
Chill for several hours.  
Decorate with remaining cream and blueberries.
