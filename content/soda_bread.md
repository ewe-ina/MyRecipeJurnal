## Soda Bread

![def]

    👉 18 slices, approx. 103 kcal each
    👉 Loaf pan: 26 x 11 cm  
    👉 Oven: top and bottom heat, 200°C (392°F), 40 min + 10 min covered with foil

### 🌿 Ingredients

    ⬜ 400 ml soy milk  
    ⬜ 1 tablespoon vinegar  
    ⬜ 1 teaspoon lemon juice  
    ⬜ 2 teaspoons baking soda  
    ⬜ 500 g flour (I used 100 g whole wheat graham flour and 400 g regular flour)  
    ⬜ 1 teaspoon salt  
    ⬜ 2 tablespoons black cumin seeds (nigella seeds)  

### 📝 Instructions

1. Pour the soy milk and vinegar into a bowl. Let it sit for a moment until it curdles and turns into a buttermilk substitute.  
2. Add lemon juice and baking soda — the mixture will fizz a bit 🙂  
3. Add the flour, salt, and black cumin seeds (or any other flavor you like — oregano, sunflower seeds, etc.).  
4. Stir roughly with a spoon just until combined. (Don't overmix, or the bread will be dense 😉)  
5. Transfer the dough to a greased or parchment-lined loaf pan (unless you have a non-stick pan — I don’t 😉).  
6. Bake in a preheated oven (top and bottom heat, 200°C) for 40 minutes.  
7. Cover the top with aluminum foil and bake for another 10 minutes to prevent the crust from overbrowning.  
8. After baking, remove the bread from the pan to prevent steaming.  
9. Let it cool completely before slicing — hot bread is hard to cut. It’s best sliced the next day.
