#### 🍪 Cookies  

&emsp; <input type="checkbox"> 1 ripe banana </br>
&emsp; <input type="checkbox"> 4 tbsp coconut oil (slightly heaped 😉) </br>
&emsp; <input type="checkbox"> 1/2 cup powdered sugar </br>
&emsp; <input type="checkbox"> 1 tsp baking soda </br>
&emsp; <input type="checkbox"> pinch of salt </br>
&emsp; <input type="checkbox"> 2 cups all-purpose wheat flour </br>

My banana wasn’t super soft yet, and since I still live blender-free, I broke it into pieces and microwaved it for 30 seconds (you can heat the coconut oil too if solid — I didn’t need to).  

Mash the banana with a fork, add soft coconut oil and powdered sugar.  
Beat with a mixer or (like me) with a wooden pestle — it works surprisingly well.  

Add baking soda, salt, and 1 cup of flour. Mix and knead.  
Add the second cup gradually so you don’t overdo it.  

The dough should come off the bowl and hands easily — soft, elastic, compact.  
If it is, stop adding flour (I had some left).  

Chill the dough 20 min in the fridge.  
Roll out 1/3 of it, cut out shapes, and transfer them onto a lined baking tray.  

Bake 12 min (add 1 min if thicker).  
Let cool — warm cookies are soft, then they turn nicely crisp 🙂

#### 🍥 Icing  

&emsp; <input type="checkbox"> a little water </br>
&emsp; <input type="checkbox"> a little more powdered sugar 😉 </br>
&emsp; <input type="checkbox"> food coloring </br>
&emsp; <input type="checkbox"> sugar hearts </br>

Add powdered sugar to a glass, break up clumps, and add water **drop by drop**.  
Mix until it reaches the consistency of thick cream.  

Add coloring or beet juice (skip the water then).  
Spread over cookies using a decorating bottle.  
Top with sugar hearts and let set.

Enjoy! 💙
