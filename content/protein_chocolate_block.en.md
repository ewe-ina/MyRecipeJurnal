Chocolate block? Make it from beans!  
So I did 🙂

#### Ingredients  

&emsp; <input type="checkbox"> about 20 dates (100 g) </br>
&emsp; <input type="checkbox"> 1 can black beans </br>
&emsp; <input type="checkbox"> 2 tablespoons peanut butter (40 g) </br>
&emsp; <input type="checkbox"> 50 g shredded coconut </br>
&emsp; <input type="checkbox"> 2 tablespoons cocoa (20 g) </br>
&emsp; <input type="checkbox"> 50 g chocolate protein powder (I used Vegan Blend) </br>

#### Preparation  

Pour warm water over the dates and let them soak for 20 minutes.  
Blend the dates, drained beans, peanut butter, and shredded coconut until relatively smooth.  
Add cocoa and protein powder. I recommend kneading the mixture with your hands — like dough.  
(If it's too dry, add a little of the soaking water.)  

You'll get a flexible, squishy dough you can shape however you like 🙂
Balls, hearts, little figures!
Or take the easy path (like I did) and shape a block 😉  

Place your creations in the freezer — small pieces for a short while, the block overnight.  
After freezing, cut into pieces — I got 11.  

Store in the fridge (short term) or freezer (longer).

Enjoy! 💙
