Slice off the tops of the peppers (keep the stems) and remove the seeds.  
Cook the rice until fluffy.  

Sauté the sliced onion in a bit of oil. Add chopped mushrooms, salt, and pepper, and continue frying until soft.

In each pepper, layer a slice of mozzarella at the bottom, then fill halfway with the mushroom mixture, add another slice of mozzarella, more filling, and finish with one last slice on top.  

Arrange the peppers snugly in a buttered baking dish.  
Bake for about 1 hour in a preheated oven at 180°C (≈355°F).
