🔹 8 small tortillas + 1 lunch jar (500 ml)

---

#### Ingredients

##### 🌯 Mini tortilla wraps (8 pcs)

(Yes, I used store-bought ones — but at least they’re palm oil–free!)

##### 🍚 Filling

&emsp; <input type="checkbox"> ~200 g brown rice </br>
&emsp; <input type="checkbox"> 1/2 tsp salt </br>
&emsp; <input type="checkbox"> 1 can red kidney beans </br>
&emsp; <input type="checkbox"> 3 spring onions </br>
&emsp; <input type="checkbox"> 1/2 red bell pepper </br>
&emsp; <input type="checkbox"> a mix of Mexican-style spices </br>

##### 🥬 Toppings

&emsp; <input type="checkbox"> lettuce leaves </br>
&emsp; <input type="checkbox"> 1 carrot </br>
&emsp; <input type="checkbox"> a bit of chives </br>

#### Preparation

1. Cook the rice in salted water.
2. In another pot, pour in the beans with their liquid, add chopped onions and diced bell pepper.
3. Simmer under a lid for a few minutes (until the pepper softens slightly).
4. Meanwhile, slice the carrot into thin strips — keep a few round slices, too.
5. Add the spice mix and stir in the rice. (I started by layering a bit of rice in my jar, added carrot slices, poured over the bean mixture, and sprinkled with chives — worked perfectly!), mix everything and remove from heat.
6. Warm the tortillas on a dry, hot pan (just a few seconds per side). Lay down a lettuce leaf, add a couple of carrot strips, spoon in the rice-bean mix, and sprinkle with chives.

And just like that — another quick lunch is ready 😉  

Enjoy! 💙
