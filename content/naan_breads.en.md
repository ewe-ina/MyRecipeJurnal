For everyone who dreams of fresh bread without leaving the house 🔥

🔹 4 breads </br>
🔹 from the pan </br>

#### Ingredients

&emsp; <input type="checkbox"> ¼ cup warm water </br>
&emsp; <input type="checkbox"> ½ teaspoon cane sugar </br>
&emsp; <input type="checkbox"> 1 cup all-purpose flour </br>
&emsp; <input type="checkbox"> ½ packet instant yeast (4 g) </br>
&emsp; <input type="checkbox"> a pinch of salt </br>
&emsp; <input type="checkbox"> 2 tablespoons olive oil or other oil </br>

#### Preparation

Add sugar to the warm water and let it dissolve.  
In a bowl, combine flour, yeast and salt, whisking to aerate.  
Add the oil and slowly pour in the water, mixing first with a spoon and then with your hand.  
The dough should be smooth and elastic — add flour if too sticky or a splash of water if too dry.  

Cover the bowl with a cloth and let the dough rest for about an hour.  
Divide it into 4 pieces, flatten each into a thin round and let them rest for 10 minutes.  

Heat a dry pan well and cook each naan for 1–2 minutes per side until lightly browned.  

They’re amazing warm — and can even be sliced open nicely.  
(This dough also works perfectly as a quick pizza base.)  

Perfect for a slow Saturday breakfast: I make the dough, go for a run, walk the dog — and by the time I’m back, breakfast together is actually possible 😉

Enjoy! 💙
