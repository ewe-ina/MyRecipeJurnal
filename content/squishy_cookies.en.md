Inspired by Natalia’s recipe originally called “one-batch squishies” 😃

---

🔹 1 large baking tray </br>
🔹 Oven: top-bottom heat, 180°C / 350°F, 14 min </br>

#### Ingredients

&emsp; <input type="checkbox"> 1 very ripe banana </br>
&emsp; <input type="checkbox"> 200 g coconut oil </br>
&emsp; <input type="checkbox"> 200 g xylitol </br>
&emsp; <input type="checkbox"> a few drops of rum extract </br>
&emsp; <input type="checkbox"> 1 teaspoon baking soda </br>
&emsp; <input type="checkbox"> a pinch of salt </br>
&emsp; <input type="checkbox"> 2 cups flour </br>
&emsp; <input type="checkbox"> 1/2 bar of dark chocolate, chopped (or whatever you grab by accident 😉) </br>

#### Preparation

1. Mash the banana with a fork in a mixing bowl.
2. Add coconut oil and xylitol. Mix – I used a wooden spoon because I was too lazy to pull out the mixer 😉
3. Add rum extract, baking soda, salt, and part of the flour. Mix and knead by hand – the dough should feel like playdough. If it’s too wet or sticky, add the rest of the flour.  
4. Add chopped chocolate and knead everything together.
5. Spread the dough over a large baking tray lined with silicone mat or baking paper.  
   (Or make little balls and flatten them – you’ll get two trays of cookies 😉)
6. Bake in a preheated oven (top-bottom heat, 180°C / 350°F) for 14 minutes, until golden on top.
7. Let cool, then cut into squares.

Ask your testers if it was good 😃
I loved them

Enjoy! 💙
